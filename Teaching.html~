<h2> <center> Teaching </center></h2>
<p>

<em>
Mathematics is ubiquitous in its applications to the real world, its artful beauty, and its puzzling intrigue. As a math professor, my task is to try to bring all this into a university classroom.
</em>

<br>

After completing my Ph.D., I taught full time for three years primarily at University of San Diego, but also at San Diego State University and Miramar College.  For a detailed list of my teaching experience see my <a href="CurriculumVitae.pdf">CV</a>. For a copy of my Teaching Statement please email me.

</p><h2>Teaching Experience:</h2>

I have been the instructor of record for the following classes.
<ul>
	<li> Calculus I</li>
	<li> Calculus II</li>
	<li> Applied Mathematics for Science and Engineering</li>
	<li> College Algebra</li>
	<li> Intermediate Algebra</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Calculus</u></h3>
For the past two years I have been teaching almost entirely Calculus I and Calculus II.  The reason I like Calculus is 
that, for many students, Calculus is their introduction to a mature treatment of university-level mathematics.  This gives
me, as the instructor, a unique opportunity to lay the foundation for logical reasoning and mature mathematical thinking.
I try to accomplish this goal by first identifying Calculus as a subject that is entirely different from College Algebra,
Statistics, and any other high school math they may have previously taken.  The reason it is different is that 
<em>limits</em> allow for the discussion of <em>continuous</em> properties of functions, in contrast to the largely discrete
world of Pre-Calculus based math.  The first day of class (and many days after) I say the phrase

<p>
</p><center><em>The true power of Calculus is the ability to turn gross approximations into exact statements using LIMITS.
</em></center>

<p>
The importance of this statement is exemplified by the fact that all the fundamental objects in Calculus (derivative, integral and Taylor Series) all involve limits.
</p><p>

</p><center><img src="./Limits.jpg"></center>

<p>

Recently I explored these concepts with students by asking them to build these concepts from the ground up, in what I 
call a build report.  Here I ask for a full-page report, written in complete sentences, that is broken up into four sections.
</p><ul>
	<li><em>OBJECTIVE:</em> This section states what is to be measure and what formulas will be used in relevant units.</li>

	<li><em>QUICK APPROXIMATION:</em> Here the student performs an approximation by assuming the appropriate function is 
	constant (`appropriate' changes its meaning depending on the calculus object being constructed).</li>
	
	<li><em>GENERAL APPROXIMATION</em> The approximation above is made into a more general one by assuming the size of 
	the interval, number of rectangles, or degree of an approximating polynomial, is a parameter that can be varied.</li>

	<li><em>LIMIT OF APPROXIMATION</em> The appropriate limit is taken and the calculus object is now constructed.</li> 

</ul>

The purpose of this, admittedly laborious, task is show the connection between finite difference or finite sum 
approximations of calculus concepts and their exact correlates (i.e. the calculus objects themselves).  Most calculus 
students can put together an approximation of speed or area and most can take an derivative and an integral, but very few 
can connect the approximation to derivative formula, or integral formula.

<h3><u>Teaching Philosophy</u></h3>
<p>

I have taught mostly in a small classroom environment, approximately 35-40 students, and I enjoy the degree of interaction 
with each student that this class size allows.  As much as I can, I try to break from the model of a lecturer and listeners to a
much more interactive classroom where students can take control of their own learning environment. To support this 
interactive classroom I constantly pose questions to the class and give daily in-class exercises.  The in-class exercises serve to
give me feedback as to how well my message is being communicated, as much as give a metric to the students how much they are 
absorbing.

I have experience teaching mostly lower division classes, therefore I spend a lot of time trying to motivate the concepts I 
present to a wider audience.  Calculus I consists of students with every major under the sun.  During my first day of Calc I,
I present six NON-hard-science applications of calculus in everyday life (political situations, economic situations and 
sociological situations).  Appealing to a wide audience is crucial when teaching calculus.   




In my carreer as an educator I have specifically avoided teaching a wide variety of courses.  My teaching resume repeats 
clases by design.  I believe that it takes practice to perfect the way to teach a class.  





<h3><u>Teaching in Graduate School</u></h3>
During my time in graduate school I have been a teaching assistant to a wide variety of courses, including upper division math courses and one interdepartmental graduate course.  As a teaching assistant my responsibilities were to lead discussions, write and administer quizzes, hold office hours, and grade and proctor exams.  Below is a list of some of the courses I have
been a teaching assistant for.
<ul>
<li>Calculus</li>
<li>Multi-Variable Calculus</li>
<li>Infinite Series and Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Introduction to Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Elementary Differential Equations</li>
<li>Boolean Algebra and Logic</li>
<li>Probability and Statistics fo Computer Scientists</li>
<li>Numerical Analysis</li>
<li>Systems Cell Biology, Dept. of Biology.</li>
</ul>
