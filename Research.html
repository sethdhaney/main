</p><h2><u>Research Interests</u></h2>

<p>
The frontier of biological research requires an understanding of the vast array complex processes that contribute to the dynamics of life.  In every area of biology from cancer biology to environmental sustainability, nonlinear and stochastic dynamics contribute to the function of biological systems.  My work explores the role of such complex processes in biological systems.  Specifically, I seek out biological systems where (1) techniques from dynamical systems and perturbation theory can be exploited to reduce complexity and (2) systems where stochastic variation creates otherwise unpredictable changes in dynamics.  I have applied these techniques to problems in neuroscience, cancer and cell signaling, and community ecology.

<b>1. Information coding and memory in olfactory system.</b>
</p>
<p>
The olfactory system accomplishes an amazing task of representing a vast array of chemical stimuli, odorants.  Further, these odorants are strongly linked with memory and emotion.  The insect olfactory system provides a unique example to study the formation of olfactory memory with a computationally feasibly sized model system. The long-term goal of this research is to reveal the network and synaptic mechanisms involved in olfactory encoding and olfactory memory.  To this aim, we have shown that theoretically attractive and biologically realistic plasticity mechanisms, spike-timing dependent plasticity, can facilitate sparse representations of odorants which are specifically advantageous for memory storage. Further, we have shown that adaptation in primary sensory neurons in olfaction leads to an efficient strategy to remain sensitive to novel odorants.

<b>2. Phase Shifts in Cancer and Mechanics of Cell Signaling. </b> 
</p>
<p>
Cancer is a dynamic disease.  Many forms of cancer (for example chronic myelogenous leukemia, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer) originate in a benign form, which is largely asymptomatic (at times so much so that it goes undetected).  However, after long dormancy periods, potentially lasting years, the disease progresses to later and more aggressive phases where it can become lethal. The long-term goal of this work is to study the dynamic properties of cancer progression and predict the factors that play a role in transitioning between asymptomatic phases to terminal phases.  We hope to exploit these critical factors to propose novel treatments. Our work in this area suggests that overproduction of feedback inhibitors can create positive feedbacks which cause both delays and sudden shifts to a more aggressive disease.  Our previous experience studying the role of positive feedbacks in preventing aberrant crosstalk in intra-cellular signaling is particularly informative, as crosstalk can lead to spurious gene activation and potentially cancer.

<b>3. Theoretical Community Ecology. </b> 
</p>
<p>
	The environment is rich with a vast amount of biodiversity. In order to sustain this biodiversity, communities must find a way to mitigate competition.  A classical approach to this problem involves partitioning resources into discrete niches.  However, new theoretical and experimental advances have paved the way for dynamic mechanisms of niche differentiation that allow for niches to form not only based on the types of resources each species uses, but the timing in which they use them.  We use stochastic and nonlinear models to study the manner in which complex dynamics contributes to species coexistence.  In particular, we constructed a mathematical model to show that stochastic effects will drive, even niche-differentiated, systems to extinction.  We also used this model to calculate the resolution of current experimental methodology and determine its sensitivity to natural stochastic variation.

	<li><b>The Offset Response in Olfaction</b> University of California, Riverside. <em>2015-Current</em><br>
	This is a collaboration with Debajit Saha and Baranidharan Raman at Washington University in St. Louis. The olfactory system in insects is well known for producing oscillatory behavior upon stimulus onset. However, upon stimulus offset the olfactory system responds with an equally large neural response, perhaps indicating that the termination of olfactory stimulus is as important as its presentation. We have constructed a large computational model of the insect olfactory system to explore the mechanisms responsible for creating this offset response and its consequences for olfactory coding and memory. 
	<li><b>Mecahnisms of Phase Transition in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)</b> University of California, Riverside. <em>2015-Current</em><br>
	CML is a unique form of cancer in that its origin can be mapped to a single genetic disruption via the creation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene.  This gene has many profound effects on the disease: increasing genetic instability, altering differentiation program, inhibiting apoptosis, etc. We build a computation model of the dynamics of BCR-ABL in each of these different regimes and build and understanding of progression in CML. 
	<li><b>Effects of Maladaptation on Coexistence</b> University of California, Riverside. <em>2015-Current</em><br>
	Migrating species that invade a local ecosystem will be maladapted precise local conditions. How might this maladaptation affect the possibility of overcoming competitive exclusion?  We develop mathematical models to explore this question.
	<li><b>Sleep Fragmentation Has Profound Effects on Cancer Risk</b> University of California, Riverside. <em>2015-Current</em><br>
	Sleep framgmentation causes a significant increase in cancer risk. It has been hypothesized that this effect is mediated through the recently discovered Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs). We create a computational model of sleep disruption, TAMs, and cancer to investigate feedbacks in this system.
